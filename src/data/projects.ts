The app connects to HoYoverse's official API to fetch real-time player data, including character builds, equipment (relics), and statistics. Players can input their game UID to automatically import their character roster and equipment inventory. The core feature is an intelligent scoring system that evaluates relic quality using weighted algorithms, helping players identify which equipment pieces are worth upgrading and which characters have the most optimized builds. This eliminates the guesswork in equipment management and provides data-driven insights for character progression. Built with modern technologies and optimized for performance, achieving 86% faster API responses and deployed on Azure for reliable access.",
